    """Mean of square value of a tensor, alongside the specified axis.

    Arguments:
        input: A tensor.
        axis: A list of integer. Axes to compute the mean.
        keepdims: A boolean, whether to keep the dimensions or not.
            If `keepdims` is `False`, the rank of the tensor is reduced
            by 1 for each entry in `axis`. If `keepdims` is `True`,
            the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1.

    Returns:
        A tensor with the mean of element-wise square value of `input`.

    Notice: There is some precision problem for the operator and remain to solve

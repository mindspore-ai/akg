 *
 * We use Relay's type system as the unified type system
 * throughout the stack.
 *
 * This file contains types that are common across IR variants.
 *
 * ## Relation between Type and runtime::DataType
 *
 * Besides Type, we also store a dtype field in the low-level PrimExpr.
 * runtime::DataType(dtype) provides coarse grained type information
 * during compile time and runtime. It is eagerly built in
 * low-level expression construction and can be used for
 * quick type checking in the low-level IR.
 * For example, when an Expr's dtype is int32,
 * we know for sure that its type is also int32.
 *
 * On the other hand, Type provides more fine grained information.
 * For example, a low level expression can have DataType::Handle() as
 * its dtype and MemRef[float32] as its type.
 * Types are usually lazily constructed via type checking,
 * so they may not readily be available during IR construction.
 *
 * The unified Type serves as a common bridge across IR dialects.
 * For example, we require all the functions to have a type signature,
 * which allow us to build cross dialect function calls.

 * Mark each scalar statement with a "realize_UB" mark node. "root" should be
 * either a domain node or a filter node.
 *
 * First, check whether each statement in "root" is scalar. Each set of the
 * union set represented by "root" represents a statement. We determine a scalar
 * statement with "HasNoDims" function, checking whether a give "set" has dims.
 *
 * Next, check whether the subtree of "root" has permutable bands, and return
 * "root" if there are any permutable bands.
 *
 * Obtain the outermost permutable band, and this would go down to either a leaf
 * node or a sequence/set node.
 *
 * If it comes to a leaf node, "root" represents a single scalar statement. Insert
 * an empty band and mark this empty band with a "realize_UB" mark.
 *
 * If a sequence/set node is encountered, meaning "root" represents multiple
 * scalar statements. Mark each child recursively with a "realize_UB" mark.
 *
 * Return the original "root" in other cases.

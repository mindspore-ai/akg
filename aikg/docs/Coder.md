# Coder Module Documentation

## 1. Overview
The `Coder` module is one of the core components of the `AIKG` system. It is responsible for converting front-end inputs, such as pseudocode or design documents generated by the `Designer`, into specific kernel `Kernel` code. Currently, the `Coder` supports multiple implementation types, including `SWFTCoder` and `TritonCoder`, enabling the generation of optimized kernel `Kernel` code for different hardware architectures and frameworks.

## 2. Main Functions

### 2.1 Core Responsibilities
- **Code Conversion**: Transforms abstract designs into concrete hardware implementation code.
- **Code Repair**: Fixes the generated code based on feedback and suggestions.

### 2.2 Workflow
1. Receives pseudocode/design documents generated by the `Designer`.
2. Selects the corresponding code generation strategy (initial generation / repair with suggestions) based on the implementation type.
3. Calls the `LLM API` to generate the target code.
4. Returns the generated code, prompts, and inference process.

## 3. SWFTCoder

`SWFTCoder` is specialized for generating `swft` Python code and has the following features:

1. **API Retrieval**: Retrieves `swft` API definitions and usage based on documentation and the current context.
2. **Sample Code**: Uses `swft` sample code to add to the prompt.
3. **Code Generation**: Generates `swft` Python code.
4. **Error Repair/Improvement**: Improves the current code based on suggestions.


## 4. TritonCoder

`TritonCoder` is specialized for generating `triton` Python code and has the following features:

1. **API Reference**: Refers to the `triton` API documentation to understand API usage.
2. **Sample Code**: Uses `triton` sample code as a template.
3. **Code Generation**: Generates `triton` kernel code.
4. **Error Repair/Improvement**: Improves the current code based on suggestions.

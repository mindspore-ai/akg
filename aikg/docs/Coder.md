# Coder Design Document

## Overview
The Coder is a core component in the AI Kernel Generator that converts algorithm designs into concrete implementation code. It inherits from `AgentBase` and is responsible for transforming high-level algorithm sketches (generated by Designer) into executable kernel code for specific hardware platforms and frameworks.

## Core Functions
- **Design-to-Code Translation**: Converts algorithm designs into concrete implementation code
- **Doc-Driven Integration**: Leverages custom reference documents for accurate code generation
- **Multi-DSL Support**: Supports various target languages (Triton, SWFT, etc.)
- **Framework Adaptation**: Generates code for different frontend frameworks (MindSpore, PyTorch, etc.)
- **Error-Guided Repair**: Fixes generated code based on verification feedback
- **API Integration**: Intelligently selects appropriate APIs based on documentation

## Initialization Parameters
| Parameter Name | Type/Required | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| op_name | str (Required) | Kernel name, identifying the specific kernel |
| task_desc | str (Required) | Task description, detailing the kernel functional requirements |
| dsl | str (Required) | Target DSL: "triton_cuda", "triton_ascend", "swft", etc. |
| framework | str (Required) | Frontend framework: "mindspore", "torch", "numpy", etc. |
| backend | str (Required) | Hardware backend: "ascend", "cuda", etc. |
| arch | str (Required) | Hardware architecture: "ascend910b4", "a100", etc. |
| workflow_config_path | str (Optional) | Workflow configuration file path (usually injected by Task from the orchestration plan) |
| config | dict (Required) | Complete orchestration plan configuration, including log_dir, agent_model_config, docs_dir, etc. (see [Task Orchestration Plan Configuration](./TaskOrchestrationPlan.md)) |

## Doc-Driven Integration

The Coder loads reference documents via `docs_dir.coder` in the orchestration plan. For document list, directory structure, and authoring guidelines, see the [Doc-Driven Integration Guide](./DocDrivenIntegration.md). Details are not duplicated here.

## Configuration Example
```yaml
# In task orchestration plan file
docs_dir:
  coder: "resources/docs/triton_ascend_docs"  # Coder reference documents
  
agent_model_config:
  coder: "your_model_name"
  api_generator: "your_api_model"  # For API document compression
```

 

## Execution Flow

1. **Initialization Stage**
   - Load workflow configuration and create parser
   - Initialize code generation templates
   - Load all reference documents using Doc-Driven Integration
   - Prepare base document structure with loaded content

2. **Processing Stage**
   - Extract algorithm design from task information
   - Process API documentation (compress if needed)
   - Incorporate conductor suggestions and error feedback

3. **Generation Stage**
   - Execute LLM generation with comprehensive context
   - Return generated code, prompt, and reasoning process

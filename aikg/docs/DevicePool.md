# DevicePool Module Design Document

## Overview
The DevicePool module is responsible for the asynchronous allocation and release management of devices such as Ascend, CUDA, and CPU. It uses a producer-consumer model to implement concurrent control of device resources.

## Initialization Parameters
| Parameter Name | Type/Required | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| device_list | List[int] (Optional) | A list of device IDs (e.g., [0, 1]), defaults to [0] |

## Environment Variable Configuration
Supports setting the device list through the environment variable `AIKG_DEVICES_LIST`, formatted as comma-separated device IDs, e.g., `0,1,2`

## Class Method Descriptions
### `acquire_device()`
Asynchronously acquires an available device.

**Return Value**
- int: Device ID

### `release_device(device_id)`
Asynchronously releases a specified device.

**Parameters**
- device_id (int): The ID of the device to be released

    Top-K Top-P Sampling operation that performs top-k and top-p sampling.
    This operation is commonly used in neural networks for:
    - Sampling from probability distributions in generative models
    - Used in language model inference for next-token prediction
    - Core component in text generation and other sampling-based algorithms
    
    Formula: 
    1. Select top-k elements
    2. Filter elements with cumulative probability <= top-p
